It also includes [Backbone.Mediator](https://github.com/chalbert/Backbone-Mediator) for Pub/Sub patterns.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nMake sure to have [Brunch.io](http://brunch.io) installed.\r\n\r\nCreate your project using Banana Pancakes with:\r\n\r\n\tbrunch new <your-project-name> -s github://Anaphase/brunch-banana-pancakes\r\n\t\t\r\nOr simply copy the repository to your hard drive and rename it.\r\n\r\n## Customize Bootstrap Stylesheets\r\n\r\nAll Bootstrap stylesheet files can be found separated into:\r\n\r\n\tvendor/styles/bootstrap\r\n\t\t\r\nThey're in original [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) format in order to be easily customized, and compiled together with the app build.\r\n\r\n## Exclude Bootstrap jQuery plugins\r\n\r\njQuery plugins used by Bootstrap are all listed (in the right order) inside the config.coffee file. Comment out the ones you want to exclude from the build with a #. (Pay attention to dependencies!)\r\n\r\n## Credit\r\nBanana Pancakes was spawned from [Brunch with Eggs and Bacon](https://github.com/nezoomie/brunch-eggs-and-bacon) because it's versions of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), and [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) were all out-of-date.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
